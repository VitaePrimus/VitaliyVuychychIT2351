  <li>For creating a stored procedure for deleting a row from the customers table, first I would need to create the procedure. I named it deleteRow and created a parameter <i>id</i> type int. Next I created a DELETE FROM function, making the table to delete from a customers table. I passed a condition to delete WHERE customer_id = id. When called, the stored procedure would require an int to be passed which would be the id of a customer that a user wishes todelete from the table.
