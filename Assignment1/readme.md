<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<p>In this assignment we install MySQL, get familiar with its interface, and make our first manipulations with a provided database. We use various resources such as the MySQL textbook and w3schools as sources of information. As a result we are able to pull and organize some information out of the provided databases.</p>

<h3>MySQL Workbench</h3>

<p>I was installing MySQL Workbench on my personal laptop using the slides and video provided. The whole process was pretty straightforward and I had no issue with installing the workbench as well as loading the database into the workbench.</p>

<h3>Queries</h3>

<p>With using the queries <b>SELECT * FROM</b> we got all of the information from the customers table. Second part of the assignment was to get specific information from the items table. So using the <b>SELECT</b> command we chose the correct columns and filtered them out so the <i>unit_price</i> was more than 16.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I found this first assignment to be informative and a good introduction to MySQL Workbench. The tutorials provided were really useful and I appreciate the first chapters of the book provided online for students who did not receive the book yet over the mail, such as myself. I am looking forward to the next week's assignment to learn more about SQL.</p>
